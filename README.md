# Wordpress Theme Boilerplate 
###_A work in progress..._

### Structure:

 - `theme` contains the theme's php files. Everything in this folder will be zipped up
   to provide the final theme.zip that can be uploaded to any wordpress site
 - `config` contains configuration files

### Pre-requisites:

- Node 
- Yarn
- Webpack (and Webpack Cli)
- Docker (and Docker Compose) 

### To get started:

- make sure Docker daemon is running
- `yarn start`
- go to localhost
